## Redactor Installations

A Redactor Developer license purchase allows a multiple “live” installation in a production environment and ancillary “development use only” installations, as needed, to support the live installation (such as development and a staging servers). Additional installations do not require the purchase of additional licenses. If you have specific installation needs not covered by this license, please contact us.
